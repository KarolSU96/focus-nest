# Focus Nest App 

HERE THE PICTURES

This is my fifth milestone project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Course. The objective of this project is to develop a Full-Stack web application using Django (DRF) for the backend and React for the frontend.

Focus Nest aims to enhance user productivity by providing a comprehensive tool for managing tasks and goals, offering the ability to organize tasks into 'collections' for better grouping.
